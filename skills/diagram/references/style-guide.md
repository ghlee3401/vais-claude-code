# Style Guide

**The single source of truth for colors, typography, and tokens.** Every diagram draws from this — not from hex values inlined in other reference files. If you want to change the visual skin, change this file by hand and re-run the SKILL.md §8 checklist (the accent must still read as "focal" on the new paper).

Default skin is a cool editorial palette — white-smoke paper, jet-black ink, atomic-tangerine accent, blue-slate muted.

## Tokens

### Semantic roles

Every token is referred to by **semantic role**, not by its hex value. Type references (`type-*.md`) and SKILL.md say `accent`, not `#eb6c36`.

| Role | Purpose | Default (light) | Default (dark) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `paper` | Page background, default node fill | `#f5f5f5` (white-smoke) | `#2d3142` (jet-black) |
| `paper-2` | Diagram container bg, secondary fill | `#ececec` | `#393e53` |
| `ink` | Primary text, primary stroke | `#2d3142` (jet-black) | `#f5f5f5` (white-smoke) |
| `muted` | Secondary text, default arrow stroke | `#4f5d75` (blue-slate) | `#bfc0c0` (silver) |
| `soft` | Sublabels, boundary labels | `#7a8399` | `#8e98ac` |
| `rule` | Hairline borders | `rgba(45,49,66,0.12)` | `rgba(245,245,245,0.12)` |
| `rule-solid` | Stronger borders, baselines | `#bfc0c0` (silver) | `rgba(191,192,192,0.25)` |
| `accent` | Focal / 1–2 max per diagram | `#eb6c36` (atomic-tangerine) | `#f08a59` |
| `accent-tint` | Fill for accent-bordered boxes | `rgba(235,108,54,0.08)` | `rgba(240,138,89,0.10)` |
| `link` | HTTP/API calls, external arrows | `#2e5aa8` | `#6a95d8` |

> **Note:** The example HTML files in `assets/` were built under an earlier skin. New diagrams use the tokens above.

### Inversion rule (light → dark)

Any `rgba(45,49,66, X)` in light becomes `rgba(245,245,245, X)` in dark. Same opacities, RGB flipped. The accent gets a slight hue-shift brighter to read on dark paper.

## Typography

| Role | Family | Size | Weight | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `title` | Instrument Serif | 1.75rem | 400 | Page H1 |
| `node-name` | Geist (sans) | 12px | 600 | Human-readable labels |
| `sublabel` | Geist Mono | 9px | 400 | Port, protocol, URL, field type |
| `eyebrow` | Geist Mono | 7–8px | 500, tracked 0.18em, uppercase | Type tags, axis labels |
| `arrow-label` | Geist Mono | 8px | 400, tracked 0.06em | Arrow annotations |
| `callout` | Instrument Serif *italic* | 14px | 400 | Editorial asides only |

### Font stack

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Instrument+Serif:ital@0;1&family=Geist:wght@400;500;600&family=Geist+Mono:wght@400;500;600&family=Noto+Serif:ital@0;1&family=Noto+Sans+KR:wght@400;500;600&family=Noto+Serif+KR:wght@400&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

Offline, the local families in each stack take over; the layout does not change.

### Korean labels

Geist and Instrument Serif carry no Hangul. A Korean `<text>` element extends its own family — never swap the skin:

```svg
<text font-family="'Geist', 'Noto Sans KR', 'Apple SD Gothic Neo', 'Malgun Gothic', sans-serif">결제 서비스</text>
```

Both Noto faces ship in the font link above, so the web font resolves before any locally installed one and the same file renders identically on macOS, Windows, and a reviewer's browser. Page titles need the serif equivalent — `'Instrument Serif', 'Noto Serif KR', serif` — or a mixed Latin/Korean title resolves Hangul through the platform's generic serif and the two halves disagree.

**Width budget.** Measure per character, not per script: **every Unicode wide or full-width character costs 1em, every other character costs its face's Latin advance** (0.60em sans, 0.62em mono), and nonspacing marks cost nothing. Sum over the string and multiply by the font size for the text width, then add padding and round the box up to the next multiple of 4.

Counting by script is the trap. `주문 v2.1` is two full-width syllables and five narrow characters; a formula that tallies Hangul, Latin letters, and spaces silently drops `2`, `.`, and `1` and sizes the box for four of its seven characters. Every rendered character costs something — measure per character, never per script.

Three rules follow from Hangul metrics:

- **Sublabels stay Latin.** Ports, protocols, field types, and URLs are Latin anyway — keep `Geist Mono` there and don't translate them. Hangul in a 9px mono sublabel is unreadable and has no mono face to fall back to.
- **Floor of 12px.** Hangul goes muddy below 12px. If a Korean name doesn't fit at 12px, cut the name — don't shrink the type.
- **Arrow labels, eyebrows, and legend text switch register.** Those slots are 7–8px Geist Mono, uppercase and tracked, which Hangul has neither a face nor legibility for. A Korean label in one of those slots becomes 12px sans at weight 500 with no tracking and no uppercase transform, and its mask rect grows to match (16px tall, width from the budget above, still rounded to a multiple of 4). Latin labels in the same diagram keep the mono treatment.

**Load-bearing rule:** Mono is for *technical* content (ports, commands, URLs, field types). Names go in Geist sans. Page title is Instrument Serif. Italic Instrument Serif is reserved for annotation callouts. **Never JetBrains Mono** as a blanket "dev" font.

## Stroke, radius, spacing

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `stroke-thin` | `0.8` | Tag-box outlines, leaf nodes |
| `stroke-default` | `1` | Most strokes |
| `stroke-strong` | `1.2` | Emphasis strokes |
| `radius-sm` | `4` | Small tags |
| `radius-md` | `6` | Node boxes |
| `radius-lg` | `8` | Containers, rings |
| `grid` | `4` | Every coord, size, and gap is divisible by 4 (hard rule) |

---

## Node type → treatment

Semantic role combinations — reference these by name in type specs.

| Type | Fill | Stroke |
|---|---|---|
| `focal` (1–2 max) | `accent-tint` | `accent` |
| `backend` | `#ffffff` (white) | `ink` |
| `store` | `ink @ 0.05` | `muted` |
| `external` | `ink @ 0.03` | `ink @ 0.30` |
| `input` | `muted @ 0.10` | `soft` |
| `optional` | `ink @ 0.02` | `ink @ 0.20` dashed `4,3` |
| `security` | `accent @ 0.05` | `accent @ 0.50` dashed `4,4` |

---

## Constraints (don't break these)

- **Contrast**: `ink` must hit WCAG AA on `paper`. `muted` must hit AA on `paper` for 11px+ text.
- **One accent**: pick one color for `accent`. Two accents erases the focal signal.
- **No rainbow palette**: if your brand ships 8 colors, pick 3 (paper, ink, accent). The rest become `muted` variants.
- **Serif + sans + mono**: three families, not more. If brand typography is all sans, keep Instrument Serif for `title` and `callout` anyway — the contrast is load-bearing.
- **Paper is warm-neutral, not pure white**: pure white turns the design sterile.
- **Dot pattern is optional, not default**: the default background is a clean `paper` fill, no pattern.
- **Container is clean by default**: the diagram sits directly on the page paper, no secondary container background or border.
